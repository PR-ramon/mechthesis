\section{Introduction}


Turbulent boundary layers (TBLs) play an essential role in a wide range of areas, including atmospheric flows, aircraft design or turbine blades. Assessing the effect of streamwise pressure gradients on TBLs is critical to completely understand these applications \cite{harun_monty2013, Maciel_2018}, and this is very challenging due to the complex effect of flow history on the local state of turbulence \cite{bobke2017, tanarro_2020, Kitsios2017}. Here we study adverse-pressure-gradient (APG) effects on TBLs on statistically two-dimensional flows subjected to a nearly-constant APG magnitude leading to near-equilibrium conditions \cite{Marusic_McKeon_2010, Nagib_2008}.
% The turbulent character of the flow is analysed through the Reynolds decomposition \cite{Rey_decomp} of the fluid variables into a mean flow (averaged in time and the homogeneous spanwise direction) and a fluctuating component.
% Through this statistical approach, the mean flow has been extensively studied and some universal laws have been established, such as the law of the wall \cite{vonKarman1931}, the defect law and log-law  \cite{millikan39}, together with various approaches to account for different flow configurations \cite{Luchini_2017}. 
% One important tool for mathematical modeling of physical systems is scaling, which in the context of turbulent flows has been used for assessing the physics at higher Reynolds numbers~\cite{Hultmark_2012}, and also in combination with symmetry analyses~\cite{Oberlack_2022}.
% The approach taken in this work is based on scaling different energetic regions of the boundary layer at high Reynolds numbers, and it can be useful for other multi-scale systems where there are different energy scales interacting with each other. In these cases, a marginal integration of the scales of various sizes can lead to understanding the relative relevance and sensitivity of the various scales.

% In this study we assess the fluctuating components of APG TBLs, denoted by Reynolds stresses (RSs), where the streamwise normal component $\overline{u^2}$ is the most energetic. Note that $\overline{(\cdot)}$ denotes the average in time and the homogeneous spanwise direction.

% In APG TBLs we deal mainly with two parameters: the Reynolds number and the APG magnitude, where the latter can also be a function of the streamwise position.
% % \rev{It is interesting to find scaling factors for certain characteristics of the flow such that they can collapse with Reynolds number and/or APG magnitude, so as to further understand the physical behavior of the flow.}
% Kitsios {\it et al.}~\cite{Kitsios2016, Kitsios2017} used an integral approach to self-similarity in order to obtain scaling factors for the Reynolds stresses, and compared the spectra of a ZPG and an APG. 
% The integral scaling factor they used was the displacement thickness, which is defined as $\delta^*=\int_0^{\delta_{99}} (1 - U/U_{e}) \mathrm{d}y $, where $U$ is the mean streamwise velocity and $U_e$ is the velocity at the edge of the boundary layer ($y=\delta_{99}$). Note that $x$, $y$ and $z$ are the streamwise, wall-normal and spanwise coordinates, respectively. 
% % \rev{The outer peak of all the RSs was shown to be at $y \approx 1.2\delta^*$ in Kitsios {\it et al.}~\cite{Kitsios2016} for their mild-APG simulation and at $y \approx \delta^*$ for their strong-APG case~\cite{Kitsios2017}. }
% Following this RS scaling, Maciel {\it et al.}~\cite{Maciel_2018} and Sanmiguel Vila {\it et al.}~\cite{Sanmiguel_PRF} scaled the outer peaks of the RSs with $\delta^*$ and $\delta_{99}$ for several numerical and experimental databases with a large range of APG magnitudes. 
% % \rev{ The former focused on non-equilibrium databases, such as the APG TBLs around wing profiles, and the latter showed results for experimental near-equilibrium TBLs developing on flat plates. }
% In these studies, it was found that the wall-normal location of the outer peak of the RSs scales with $\delta^*$, making it a scaling independent of the Reynolds number and APG effects. 

% Note that Maciel {\it et al.}~\cite{Maciel_2018} reflected on the $\delta^*$ scaling of the wall-normal location of the outer peak, $y_{\rm OP}$. Since $\delta^*/\delta_{99}$ decays slowly to zero when the Reynolds number tends to infinity, this would imply that the outer peak approaches the wall, therefore $\delta^*$ would only scale $y_{\rm OP}$, but not necessarily the size of the outer region.

% Despite the different values for the wall-normal location of the outer peaks in the RSs for moderate and strong APGs documented in Ref.~\cite{Kitsios2017}, the spectral outer peak for the ZPG and the strong-APG cases were shown to be at the same wall-normal location: $y \approx \delta^*$. 

% In other studies where $\delta_{99}$ was used for scaling the outer region of the TBL \cite{Lee2017, bobke2017}, the outer-spectral-peak wavelength $\lambda_z$ appears to scale better in both ZPG and APG with $\delta_{99}$ than with $\delta^*$. 

% Based on the work by Pozuelo {\it et al.}~\cite{Pozuelo_JFM_22}, in APG TBLs the wall-normal location and magnitude of the near-wall peak, denoted here by $y_{\rm IP}$ and $\overline{u^2}_{\rm IP}$ respectively, were found to increase with Reynolds number and APG magnitude using inner scaling. In this scaling, the viscous length $\ell_{\tau}=\nu/u_{\tau}$ and the friction velocity $u_{\tau}$ are employed, where $\nu$ is the fluid kinematic viscosity and $u_{\tau}=\sqrt{\tau_w/\rho}$ (where $\tau_w$ is the wall-shear stress and $\rho$ is the fluid density). The superscript `+'  will be used to denote inner scaling.
% Regarding the outer peak, its wall-normal location $y_{\rm OP}$ was found to be approximately constant when scaled with either the displacement thickness $\delta^*$ or the boundary-layer thickness $\delta_{99}$, since for a moderate APG $\delta^*/\delta_{99}$ decreases slowly with the Reynolds number.
% With the former length scale, $y_{\rm OP}/\delta^*$ appeared to be less influenced by the APG, obtaining an approximate value of 1.4, while using $\delta_{99}$, the locations varied with APG magnitude.
