The analysis of the $\overline{u^2}$ spectrum for APG TBLs conducted here included using different length scales for the wall-normal location and the spanwise wavelength.
The inner region in TBLs with moderate APG exhibits the classical results reported for other wall-bounded flows, where the viscous scaling leads to marginal variations with Reynolds number.
The wall-normal location of the outer spectral peak has been shown to scale with $\delta^*$ and its wavelength scales with a different outer scale: $\delta_{99}$. 
While the MCE contours are also useful to observe the limits of the inner and outer scalings, they also reveal that the small-scale energy present in the outer region of APG TBLs scales with $\delta^*$. The scales between $\lambda_z=0.3\delta^*$ and $\lambda_z=\delta^*$ may have larger energy levels at higher Reynolds numbers, but their MCE shows that they contribute in a similar proportion to the total outer energy level.
