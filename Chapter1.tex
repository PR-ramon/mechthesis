Throughout my academic career, I have enjoyed the step-by-step process of learning and I have discovered a passion for sharing my knowledge with friends, colleagues and some of my students.
In the same way the process of learning is unique, the process of teaching or communicating the knowledge should also be personal, trying to achieve the main goal of communication, transmitting correct information.
When we try to learn about a subject we can go to books, classes, different teachers, publications..., and sometimes we understand better from a book, other times from a video or a specific teacher or friend.
In this thesis, I will present some results on the physics of turbulent fluid mechanics where I have been involved, and I will try my best to communicate this knowledge to those interested in reading this work even if the reader is not very familiar with fluid dynamics.
Ideally, this transmission of knowledge should be concise, but I have experienced that certain complex knowledge sometimes requires different points of view or a simpler language. Personally, I like to communicate my knowledge as if it was a conversation instead of formal and impersonal writing.

Fluid mechanics or dynamics may sound as something complex for the non initiated, and it really is a complex science, but we already have intuitive and practical knowledge since we live and manipulate fluids every day so I will explain the basics.

A fluid is a substance that in contrast with a solid, it can easily deform and this property allows for the substance to adapt to containers or to move around other obstacles. An example is the air of the atmosphere, the liquid water in the sea, and even solids, like large accumulations of fine sand which subjected to vibrations can behave similar to liquid water.
Fluid mechanics is the science that studies everything related to the movement of fluids, like the forces involved or the properties of the fluid in its motion.

When a fluid moves around a solid (water around a rock), or the solid moves immersed in a fluid  (car moving through the air of the atmosphere) the fluid adapts to that relative motion by changing its properties, such as the velocity of its particles.
Where the fluid meets the solid, its particles have the same velocity as the solid because the forces in the interface fluid-solid (friction and pressure forces) are enough to deform the fluid.
The viscosity is the property of the fluid that opposes to the deformation. Inside the fluid, the viscosity is seeing as a force that reduces the velocity of the deformation or the velocity of the fluid particles.
In the example of the water in a river moving around a rock, far from the rock, the velocity of the water is that of the river, however the water in contact to the rock is not moving according to what we have explained earlier. The viscosity is responsible to adapt the velocity of the fluid from the velocity of the river to the velocity of the rock.
The change of velocity is actually done in a very small distance, and this region where the viscosity forces are adapting the fluid velocity is called boundary layer. 
The idea of boundary layer was introduced by Ludwig Prandtl in 1904 and it is the main topic of this thesis.
