I would like to thank Ricardo Vinuesa and Philipp Schlatter first, without them I wouldn't have lived this wonderful adventure
which was to conduct my PhD studies in KTH. 
Qiang Li, a collaborator in my publications, but also a mentor, always encouraging me and ready to help. They have helped and guided me through my academic work and have always been there to share their knowledge an experience.
I also have to thank all those PhD's and professors that have made the life in the office so wonderful, in spite of the huge change that covid brought to our lifes.
Luca, Simon, Valerio and Vitor, with whom I lived my first "western" adventure. And the list goes on and on.
My family and friends in Spain that missed me so much, and my small "family" in Sweden for your moral support in good and dark times.
