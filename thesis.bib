  abstract = {Reynolds-number effects in the adverse-pressure-gradient (APG) turbulent boundary layer (TBL) developing on the suction side of a NACA4412 wing section are assessed in the present work. To this end, we analyze four cases at Reynolds numbers based on freestream velocity and chord length ranging from Rec=100,000 to 1,000,000, all of them with 5° angle of attack. The results of four well-resolved large-eddy simulations (LESs) are used to characterize the effect of Reynolds number on APG TBLs subjected to approximately the same pressure-gradient distribution (defined by the Clauser pressure-gradient parameter β). Comparisons of the wing profiles with zero-pressure-gradient (ZPG) data at matched friction Reynolds numbers reveal that, for approximately the same β distribution, the lower-Reynolds-number boundary layers are more sensitive to pressure-gradient effects. This is reflected in the values of the inner-scaled edge velocity Ue+, the shape factor H, the components of the Reynolds-stress tensor in the outer region and the outer-region production of turbulent kinetic energy. This conclusion is supported by the larger wall-normal velocities and outer-scaled fluctuations observed in the lower-Rec cases. Thus, our results suggest that two complementing mechanisms contribute to the development of the outer region in TBLs and the formation of large-scale energetic structures: one mechanism associated with the increase in Reynolds number, and another one connected to the APG. Future extensions of the present work will be aimed at studying the differences in the outer-region energizing mechanisms due to APGs and increasing Reynolds number.},

  abstract = {The goal of this study is to present a first step towards establishing criteria aimed at assessing whether a particular adverse-pressure-gradient (APG) turbulent boundary layer (TBL) can be considered well-behaved, i.e., whether it is independent of the inflow conditions and is exempt of numerical or experimental artifacts. To this end, we analyzed several high-quality datasets, including in-house numerical databases of APG TBLs developing over flat-plates and the suction side of a wing section, and five studies available in the literature. Due to the impact of the flow history on the particular state of the boundary layer, we developed three criteria of convergence to well-behaved conditions, to be used depending on the particular case under study. (i) In the first criterion, we develop empirical correlations defining the Re��-evolution of the skin-friction coefficient and the shape factor in APG TBLs with constant values of the Clauser pressure-gradient parameter $\beta$ = 1 and 2 (note that $\beta$ = $\delta$∗/$\tau$wdPe/dx, where $\delta$∗ is the displacement thickness, $\tau$wthe wall-shear stress and dPe/dx the streamwise pressure gradient). (ii) In the second one, we propose a predictive method to obtain the skin-friction curve corresponding to an APG TBL subjected to any streamwise evolution of $\beta$, based only on data from zero-pressure-gradient TBLs. (iii) The third method relies on the diagnostic-plot concept modified with the shape factor, which scales APG TBLs subjected to a wide range of pressure-gradient conditions. These three criteria allow to ensure the correct flow development of a particular TBL, and thus to separate history and pressure-gradient effects in the analysis.},

Heat Fluid Flow 61, 117--128, 2016), obtained with the spectral-element code Nek5000, is analyzed. The Clauser pressure-gradient parameter $\beta$ ranges from ≃ 0 and 85 on the suction side, and from 0 to − 0.25 on the pressure side of the wing. The maximum Re��and Re$\tau$values are around 2,800 and 373 on the suction side, respectively, whereas on the pressure side these values are 818 and 346. Comparisons between the suction side with zero-pressure-gradient turbulent boundary layer data show larger values of the shape factor and a lower skin friction, both connected with the fact that the adverse pressure gradient present on the suction side of the wing increases the wall-normal convection. The adverse-pressure-gradient boundary layer also exhibits a more prominent wake region, the development of an outer peak in the Reynolds-stress tensor components, and increased production and dissipation across the boundary layer. All these effects are connected with the fact that the large-scale motions of the flow become relatively more intense due to the adverse pressure gradient, as apparent from spanwise premultiplied power-spectral density maps. The emergence of an outer spectral peak is observed at $\beta$ values of around 4 for $\lambda$z≃ 0.65$\delta$99, closer to the wall than the spectral outer peak observed in zero-pressure-gradient turbulent boundary layers at higher Re��. The effect of the slight favorable pressure gradient present on the pressure side of the wing is opposite the one of the adverse pressure gradient, leading to less energetic outer-layer structures.},

  abstract = {The characteristics of the coherent structures in a strongly decelerated large-velocity-defect boundary layer are analysed by direct numerical simulation. The simulated boundary layer starts as a zero-pressure-gradient boundary layer, decelerates under a strong adverse pressure gradient, and separates near the end of the domain, in the form of a very thin separation bubble. The Reynolds number at separation is Re��=3912 and the shape factor H=3.43. The three-dimensional spatial correlations of (u, u) and (u, v) are investigated and compared to those of a zero-pressure-gradient boundary layer and another strongly decelerated boundary layer. These velocity pairs lose coherence in the streamwise and spanwise directions as the velocity defect increases. In the outer region, the shape of the correlations suggest that large-scale u structures are less streamwise elongated and more inclined with respect to the wall in large-defect boundary layers. The three-dimensional properties of sweeps and ejections are characterized for the first time in both the zero-pressure-gradient and adverse-pressure-gradient boundary layers, following the method of Lozano-Dur{\'a}n et al. (J. Fluid Mech. 694, 100--130, [2012]). Although longer sweeps and ejections are found in the zero-pressure-gradient boundary layer, with ejections reaching streamwise lengths of 5 boundary layer thicknesses, the sweeps and ejections tend to be bigger in the adverse-pressure-gradient boundary layer. Moreover, small near-wall sweeps and ejections are much less numerous in the large-defect boundary layer. Large sweeps and ejections that reach the wall region (wall-attached) are also less numerous, less streamwise elongated and they occupy less space than in the zero-pressure-gradient boundary layer.},

  abstract = {Direct numerical simulations were performed to investigate the effects of an adverse pressure gradient (APG) on a turbulent boundary layer. A fully implicit fractional step method was employed to simulate the flows. Equilibrium APG flows were established using a power-law free-stream distribution, U∞∼xm. The streamwise length from the inlet was made sufficiently long that the change in free-stream velocity associated with the APG did not influence the main stream. The flow with zero pressure gradient (ZPG) was also simulated and compared with the APG flows. The spatially developing characteristics of the turbulence stresses in the non-equilibrium APG flows were carefully examined. The instantaneous flow fields and vorticity fluctuations were analyzed to characterize the response of the outer turbulence to an APG. The present numerical results showed that the mean flows are greatly affected by an APG, and the coherent structures in the outer layer of the APG flows were more activated than those in the ZPG flow which may be attributed to increased turbulence intensities, shear stresses and pressure fluctuations in the APG systems. Examination of the Reynolds stress budget revealed that the energy redistribution was enhanced in the outer layer of the APG flows compared to the ZPG flow.},

  abstract = {This manuscripts presents a study on adverse-pressure-gradient turbulent boundary layers under different Reynolds-number and pressure-gradient conditions. In this work we performed Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) measurements supplemented with Large-Eddy Simulations in order to have a dataset covering a range of displacement-thickness-based Reynolds-number 2300 <Re$\delta$∗<{\$}<Re{\_}{\{}{\backslash}delta ^{\{}*{\}}{\}}<{\$}34000 and values of the Clauser pressure-gradient parameter $\beta$ up to 2.4. The spatial resolution limits of PIV for the estimation of turbulence statistics have been overcome via ensemble-based approaches. A comparison between ensemble-correlation and ensemble Particle Tracking Velocimetry was carried out to assess the uncertainty of the two methods. The effects of $\beta$, Re and of the pressure-gradient history on turbulence statistics were assessed. A modal analysis via Proper Orthogonal Decomposition was carried out on the flow fields and showed that about 20{\%} of the energy contribution corresponds to the first mode, while 40{\%} of the turbulent kinetic energy corresponds to the first four modes with no appreciable dependence on $\beta$ and Re within the investigated range. The topology of the spatial modes shows a dependence on the Reynolds number and on the pressure-gradient strength, in line with the results obtained from the analysis of the turbulence statistics. The contribution of the modes to the Reynolds stresses and the turbulence production was assessed using a truncated low-order reconstruction with progressively larger number of modes. It is shown that the outer peaks in the Reynolds-stress profiles are mostly due to large-scale structures in the outer part of the boundary layer.},

	title = {Airfoil optimization with {CST}-parameterization for (un-)conventional demands},
	abstract = {For the development of modern airplanes new and “better” airfoils are needed. The design of a new airfoil is mostly done for a number of fixed design points by the inverse method and optimized by manual iteration. When changing the preliminary design of the airplane, the airfoil design parameters are changing continuously in the design process. Therefore a tool chain was created, which allows the parametric optimization of the airfoil and the connection with a 2D panel method with fully coupled boundary layer calculation (XFOIL) with an optimizer. This paper will show an approach for airfoil optimization using an enhanced parameterization method of the airfoil coordinates. It explains the tool chain and the influence of the parameters used. The validation results for optimizing typical main wing airfoils with and without camber changing flap are shown. Based on that validation for conventional airfoils, more complex airfoils for unconventional geometries can be optimized. First results for a high lift system on a morphing wing system for a sailplane are shown and discussed.},

	abstract = {The scope of the present project is to quantify the effects of uniform blowing and body-force damping on turbulent boundary layers subjected to a non-uniform adverse-pressure-gradient distribution. To this end well-resolved large-eddy simulations are employed to describe the ﬂow around the NACA4412 airfoil at moderate Reynolds number 200, 000 based on freestream velocity and chord length. In the present paper we focus on uniform blowing and the conference presentation will include a comparison with body-force damping applied in the same region. The inner-scaled proﬁles of the mean velocity and of selected components of the Reynolds-stress tensor are examined and compared with the uncontrolled cases. It is known that uniform blowing and adverse-pressure gradients share some similarities in their effect on the boundary layers, and our results will show that these effects are not independent. The behaviour of the skin-friction coefﬁcient is analyzed through the FIK decomposition, and the impact of this control strategy on the aerodynamic efﬁciency of the airfoil is discussed.},

The greatest potential for aerodynamic drag reduction is seen in laminar ﬂow control by boundary layer suction. While most of the research so far has been on partial laminarization by application of Natural Laminar Flow (NLF) and Hybrid Laminar Flow Control (HLFC) to wings, complete laminarization of wings, tails and fuselages promises much higher gains. The potential drag reduction and suction requirements, including the necessary compressor power, are calculated on component level using a ﬂow solver with viscid/inviscid coupling and a 3D Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) solver. The effect on total aircraft drag is estimated for a state-of-the-art mid-range aircraft conﬁguration using preliminary aircraft design methods, showing that total cruise drag can be halved compared to today’s turbulent aircraft.},

	title = {Flow {Control} for {Turbulent} {Skin}-friction drag reduction on airfoils},
	abstract = {The present thesis is focused on turbulent boundary layer control on airfoils. In particular, uniform blowing and suction is investigated regarding its inﬂuence on aerodynamic properties of airfoils covering a vast parameter space. Variations include: Reynolds number of Re = [105, 107], angle of attack of α = [−3◦, 12◦], airfoil shape, control region and size as well as the control intensity. The goal of these investigations is not to optimize a single conﬁguration but to gain knowledge about beneﬁts and costs regarding the overall airfoil performance depending on the parameters considered. The calculations are done using Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes equations. The OpenFOAM CFD-toolbox is used with the steady state solver simpleFoam and ﬂow is considered incompressible. Turbulence is modeled using Menter-SST model with suppressed turbulent kinetic energy k within laminar regions. Overall more than 10100 operating points were investigated. The results are compared to literature when available and usually extend the information provided therein to a wider set of parameters. Explanations mostly focus on global eﬀects rather than detailed boundary layer investigations. Although validation with various sources shows good prediction quality of the method regarding integrated values and their tendencies there are diﬀerences in boundary layer properties compared to well resolved Large Eddy Simulations and Direct Numerical Simulations. Similar to classical airfoil design suction side control conﬁgurations show stronger eﬀects regarding airfoil performance. Blowing close to the leading edge is eﬀective regarding drag reduction but sensitive to changes in operating point. Blowing on the suction side has to be applied more thoughtfully in order to achieve beneﬁcial results than blowing on the pressure side which is usually favorable. In general blowing improves performance with Reynolds number while suction has the opposite correlation. However, depending on the conﬁguration suction might still be better even for high Reynolds numbers within the scope of parameters considered. Eﬀects of tripping or relaminarization through control mechanisms are not investigated but likely to have an inﬂuence. Yet, some conﬁgurations are chosen explicitly in a way to either utilize a speciﬁc transition position in order to have the desired boundary layer conditions in control region or stay well downstream of natural transition position.},

	abstract = {The paper presents a novel procedure that highly automates subsonic airfoil simulations using a volume resolving Reyn-olds-Averaged  Navier-Stokes  approach (RANS).  The  procedure  is  designed  to  minimize  human  interaction  to  what  is  known from 2D panel schemes like XFOIL. Natural transition effects are captured with the Ȗ-Reșmodel, which makes the approach especially suited to low Reynolds number flows. The new procedure combines existing geometry and simulation software and completely automates the setup from mesh generation to solving and post-processing. Manual interaction is reduced to specifying airfoil shapes and flow parameters. A variety of validation cases is presented comparing the novel approach to wind tunnel measurements and respective XFOIL calculations. Airfoil lift, drag, moment and transition location show very good accuracy. The novel procedure shows superior performance for critical cases that involve large laminar separation bubbles when compared to XFOIL. It greatly enhances the ability to use RANS airfoil simulations in aerodynamic research or aircraft design.},

The number of blowing sections, N, investigated is set to be 3, 6, 20, 30 and compared to N = 1, which constitutes the reference case, while the total wall-mass flux is constrained to be the same for all considered cases, corresponding to a blowing amplitude of 0.1\% of UÝ for the reference case. Results indicate that the reference case provides a net-energy saving rate of around 18\%, which initially decreases at most 2\% points for N = 3 but recovers with increasing N, where the initial reduction of the drag reduction is found to be related to the shorter streamwise length of the intermittent blowing sections. The physical decomposition of the skin friction drag through the Fukagata-Iwamoto-Kasagi (FIK) identity shows that the distribution of all components over each blowing section has similar trends, resulting in similar averaged values over the whole control region.},

	abstract = {In automotive open-jet wind tunnels reference velocity is usually measured in terms of a static pressure difference between two different cross-sectional areas of the tunnel. Most commonly used are two sections within the nozzle (Method 1: ΔP-Nozzle). Sometimes, the reference velocity is deduced from the static pressure difference between settling chamber and plenum (Method 2: ΔP-Plenum).
Investigations in three full-scale open-jet automotive wind tunnels have clearly shown that determination of reference dynamic pressure according to ΔP-Plenum is physically incorrect. Basically, all aerodynamic coefficients, including drag coefficient, obtained by this method are too low. For test objects like cars and vans it was found that the error ΔcD depends on the test object's drag blockage in an open-jet wind tunnel. On the other hand, correct determination of dynamic pressure according to ΔP-Nozzle for car and van testing requires at least a certain minimum distance from balance center to reference-tap location upstream of the nozzle exit.},

Since this phenomenon is present in practically all engineering applications, the ability to predict the transition plays a signiﬁcant role in computational ﬂuid dynamics (CFD). However, the current techniques for Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations comprise of a rather complex formulation and are therefore diﬃcult to implement and ﬁne-tune for varying ﬂow conditions. In this thesis, a promising One-equation Local Correlation-based Transition Model is implemented into OpenFOAM CFD software, for which procedure a detailed tutorial is provided. The implementation is validated by running simulations with standard zero pressure gradient ﬂat plate cases. Furthermore, the model response for varied inlet conditions is studied by examining the eﬀect of eddy viscosity ratio and freestream turbulence intensity, and a new approach of coupling the transition model with the SST-sust turbulence model is proposed. The simulation results show that the implemented transition model predicts correctly the transition in zero pressure gradient ﬂat plate cases and the estimated skin friction coeﬃcient is in good accordance with experimentally obtained results. Furthermore, the studies indicate that a consistent behaviour for the transition model is achieved when coupled with a turbulence model with sustained turbulence.},

	abstract = {The paper addresses modelling concepts based on the RANS equations for laminar-turbulent transition prediction in general-purpose CFD codes. Available models are reviewed, with emphasis on their compatibility with modern CFD methods. Requirements for engineering transition models suitable for industrial CFD codes are speciﬁed. A new concept for transition modeling is introduced. It is based on the combination of experimental correlations with locally formulated transport equations. The concept is termed LCTM -- Local Correlation-based Transition Model. An LCTM model, which satisﬁes most of the speciﬁed requirements is described, including results for a variety of different complex applications. An incremental approach was used to validate the model, ﬁrst on 2D ﬂat plates and airfoils and then on to progressively more complicated test cases such as a threeelement ﬂap, a 3D transonic wing and a full helicopter conﬁguration. In all cases good agreement with the available experimental data was observed. The authors believe that the current formulation is a signiﬁcant step forward in engineering transition modeling, as it allows the combination of transition correlations with general purpose CFD codes. There is a strong potential that the model will allow the 1st order effects of transition to be included in everyday industrial CFD simulations.},

Some of the deficiencies of the γ -Reθ model, like the lack of Galilean invariance were removed. Furthermore, the Reθ equation was avoided and the correlations for transition onset prediction have been significantly simplified.

These grooves (riblets) have heights and spacings on the order of the turbulent wall streak and burst dimensions. The riblet performance (8 percent net drag reduction thus far), sensitivity to operational/application considerations such as yaw and Reynolds number variation, an alternative fabrication technique, results of extensive parametric experiments for geometrical optimization, and flight test applications are summarized.},

The results show a great potential of achieving a higher wing loading and a higher cruising speed along with excellent low-speed ﬂight characteristics. Subsequently, different designs of the technical implementation of a variable geometry wing leading edge are considered. This paper presents the results of a study whose principal aim is to design and analyse a highly extensible section of a variable geometry wing leading edge. This section is designed as a sandwich, composed of an accordion honeycomb core with elastomeric top layers. It has a high bending stiffness as well as a high extensibility into one direction, allowing for the wing leading edge to morph downward.},

	abstract = {Low-frequency pressure fluctuations which occur at certain flow speeds are an undesired feature in many open jet wind tunnels. This so called 'wind tunnel pumping' affects the aerodynamic quality of the flow and thus the quality of the measured data. In this paper a novel approach is presented to control the pulsation phenomenon by active damping of the acoustic resonant modes of the wind tunnel circuit. The acoustic mechanism of the resonance effect was investigated using a 1/20 scale pilot wind tunnel with a complete and detailed representation of test section, ducting, turning vanes and fan. The newly devised Active Resonance Control (ARC) System essentially consists of a microphone which picks up the pressure fluctuations in the plenum, a loudspeaker which is mounted in the tunnel wall and a time delay to adjust the phase relation between the microphone signal and the loudspeaker output. The ARC system reduces the periodic pressure fluctuations by 20 dB and completely eliminates the periodic velocity fluctuations. Based on the experiences with the pilot wind tunnel an ARC System was implemented in the new Audi aeroacoustic wind tunnel. The ARC System eliminates the low-frequency flow fluctuations without introducing additional noise into the wind tunnel and thus allows high-quality aerodynamic and acoustic measurements over the entire velocity range.},

  abstract = {Reynolds-number effects in the adverse-pressure-gradient (APG) turbulent boundary layer (TBL) developing on the suction side of a NACA4412 wing section are assessed in the present work. To this end, we analyze four cases at Reynolds numbers based on freestream velocity and chord length ranging from Rec=100,000 to 1,000,000, all of them with 5° angle of attack. The results of four well-resolved large-eddy simulations (LESs) are used to characterize the effect of Reynolds number on APG TBLs subjected to approximately the same pressure-gradient distribution (defined by the Clauser pressure-gradient parameter β). Comparisons of the wing profiles with zero-pressure-gradient (ZPG) data at matched friction Reynolds numbers reveal that, for approximately the same β distribution, the lower-Reynolds-number boundary layers are more sensitive to pressure-gradient effects. This is reflected in the values of the inner-scaled edge velocity Ue+, the shape factor H, the components of the Reynolds-stress tensor in the outer region and the outer-region production of turbulent kinetic energy. This conclusion is supported by the larger wall-normal velocities and outer-scaled fluctuations observed in the lower-Rec cases. Thus, our results suggest that two complementing mechanisms contribute to the development of the outer region in TBLs and the formation of large-scale energetic structures: one mechanism associated with the increase in Reynolds number, and another one connected to the APG. Future extensions of the present work will be aimed at studying the differences in the outer-region energizing mechanisms due to APGs and increasing Reynolds number.},

  abstract = {The goal of this study is to present a first step towards establishing criteria aimed at assessing whether a particular adverse-pressure-gradient (APG) turbulent boundary layer (TBL) can be considered well-behaved, i.e., whether it is independent of the inflow conditions and is exempt of numerical or experimental artifacts. To this end, we analyzed several high-quality datasets, including in-house numerical databases of APG TBLs developing over flat-plates and the suction side of a wing section, and five studies available in the literature. Due to the impact of the flow history on the particular state of the boundary layer, we developed three criteria of convergence to well-behaved conditions, to be used depending on the particular case under study. (i) In the first criterion, we develop empirical correlations defining the Re  -evolution of the skin-friction coefficient and the shape factor in APG TBLs with constant values of the Clauser pressure-gradient parameter $\beta$ = 1 and 2 (note that $\beta$ = $\delta$∗/$\tau$wdPe/dx, where $\delta$∗ is the displacement thickness, $\tau$wthe wall-shear stress and dPe/dx the streamwise pressure gradient). (ii) In the second one, we propose a predictive method to obtain the skin-friction curve corresponding to an APG TBL subjected to any streamwise evolution of $\beta$, based only on data from zero-pressure-gradient TBLs. (iii) The third method relies on the diagnostic-plot concept modified with the shape factor, which scales APG TBLs subjected to a wide range of pressure-gradient conditions. These three criteria allow to ensure the correct flow development of a particular TBL, and thus to separate history and pressure-gradient effects in the analysis.},

Heat Fluid Flow 61, 117--128, 2016), obtained with the spectral-element code Nek5000, is analyzed. The Clauser pressure-gradient parameter $\beta$ ranges from ≃ 0 and 85 on the suction side, and from 0 to − 0.25 on the pressure side of the wing. The maximum Re  and Re$\tau$values are around 2,800 and 373 on the suction side, respectively, whereas on the pressure side these values are 818 and 346. Comparisons between the suction side with zero-pressure-gradient turbulent boundary layer data show larger values of the shape factor and a lower skin friction, both connected with the fact that the adverse pressure gradient present on the suction side of the wing increases the wall-normal convection. The adverse-pressure-gradient boundary layer also exhibits a more prominent wake region, the development of an outer peak in the Reynolds-stress tensor components, and increased production and dissipation across the boundary layer. All these effects are connected with the fact that the large-scale motions of the flow become relatively more intense due to the adverse pressure gradient, as apparent from spanwise premultiplied power-spectral density maps. The emergence of an outer spectral peak is observed at $\beta$ values of around 4 for $\lambda$z≃ 0.65$\delta$99, closer to the wall than the spectral outer peak observed in zero-pressure-gradient turbulent boundary layers at higher Re  . The effect of the slight favorable pressure gradient present on the pressure side of the wing is opposite the one of the adverse pressure gradient, leading to less energetic outer-layer structures.},

  abstract = {The characteristics of the coherent structures in a strongly decelerated large-velocity-defect boundary layer are analysed by direct numerical simulation. The simulated boundary layer starts as a zero-pressure-gradient boundary layer, decelerates under a strong adverse pressure gradient, and separates near the end of the domain, in the form of a very thin separation bubble. The Reynolds number at separation is Re  =3912 and the shape factor H=3.43. The three-dimensional spatial correlations of (u, u) and (u, v) are investigated and compared to those of a zero-pressure-gradient boundary layer and another strongly decelerated boundary layer. These velocity pairs lose coherence in the streamwise and spanwise directions as the velocity defect increases. In the outer region, the shape of the correlations suggest that large-scale u structures are less streamwise elongated and more inclined with respect to the wall in large-defect boundary layers. The three-dimensional properties of sweeps and ejections are characterized for the first time in both the zero-pressure-gradient and adverse-pressure-gradient boundary layers, following the method of Lozano-Dur{\'a}n et al. (J. Fluid Mech. 694, 100--130, [2012]). Although longer sweeps and ejections are found in the zero-pressure-gradient boundary layer, with ejections reaching streamwise lengths of 5 boundary layer thicknesses, the sweeps and ejections tend to be bigger in the adverse-pressure-gradient boundary layer. Moreover, small near-wall sweeps and ejections are much less numerous in the large-defect boundary layer. Large sweeps and ejections that reach the wall region (wall-attached) are also less numerous, less streamwise elongated and they occupy less space than in the zero-pressure-gradient boundary layer.},

  abstract = {Direct numerical simulations were performed to investigate the effects of an adverse pressure gradient (APG) on a turbulent boundary layer. A fully implicit fractional step method was employed to simulate the flows. Equilibrium APG flows were established using a power-law free-stream distribution, U∞∼xm. The streamwise length from the inlet was made sufficiently long that the change in free-stream velocity associated with the APG did not influence the main stream. The flow with zero pressure gradient (ZPG) was also simulated and compared with the APG flows. The spatially developing characteristics of the turbulence stresses in the non-equilibrium APG flows were carefully examined. The instantaneous flow fields and vorticity fluctuations were analyzed to characterize the response of the outer turbulence to an APG. The present numerical results showed that the mean flows are greatly affected by an APG, and the coherent structures in the outer layer of the APG flows were more activated than those in the ZPG flow which may be attributed to increased turbulence intensities, shear stresses and pressure fluctuations in the APG systems. Examination of the Reynolds stress budget revealed that the energy redistribution was enhanced in the outer layer of the APG flows compared to the ZPG flow.},

  abstract = {This manuscripts presents a study on adverse-pressure-gradient turbulent boundary layers under different Reynolds-number and pressure-gradient conditions. In this work we performed Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) measurements supplemented with Large-Eddy Simulations in order to have a dataset covering a range of displacement-thickness-based Reynolds-number 2300 <Re$\delta$∗<{\$}<Re{\_}{\{}{\backslash}delta ^{\{}*{\}}{\}}<{\$}34000 and values of the Clauser pressure-gradient parameter $\beta$ up to 2.4. The spatial resolution limits of PIV for the estimation of turbulence statistics have been overcome via ensemble-based approaches. A comparison between ensemble-correlation and ensemble Particle Tracking Velocimetry was carried out to assess the uncertainty of the two methods. The effects of $\beta$, Re and of the pressure-gradient history on turbulence statistics were assessed. A modal analysis via Proper Orthogonal Decomposition was carried out on the flow fields and showed that about 20{\%} of the energy contribution corresponds to the first mode, while 40{\%} of the turbulent kinetic energy corresponds to the first four modes with no appreciable dependence on $\beta$ and Re within the investigated range. The topology of the spatial modes shows a dependence on the Reynolds number and on the pressure-gradient strength, in line with the results obtained from the analysis of the turbulence statistics. The contribution of the modes to the Reynolds stresses and the turbulence production was assessed using a truncated low-order reconstruction with progressively larger number of modes. It is shown that the outer peaks in the Reynolds-stress profiles are mostly due to large-scale structures in the outer part of the boundary layer.},

  abstract  = {The characteristics of the coherent structures in a strongly decelerated large-velocity-defect boundary layer are analysed by direct numerical simulation. The simulated boundary layer starts as a zero-pressure-gradient boundary layer, decelerates under a strong adverse pressure gradient, and separates near the end of the domain, in the form of a very thin separation bubble. The Reynolds number at separation is Re?=3912 and the shape factor H=3.43. The three-dimensional spatial correlations of (u, u) and (u, v) are investigated and compared to those of a zero-pressure-gradient boundary layer and another strongly decelerated boundary layer. These velocity pairs lose coherence in the streamwise and spanwise directions as the velocity defect increases. In the outer region, the shape of the correlations suggest that large-scale u structures are less streamwise elongated and more inclined with respect to the wall in large-defect boundary layers. The three-dimensional properties of sweeps and ejections are characterized for the first time in both the zero-pressure-gradient and adverse-pressure-gradient boundary layers, following the method of Lozano-Dur{\'a}n et al. (J. Fluid Mech. 694, 100--130, [2012]). Although longer sweeps and ejections are found in the zero-pressure-gradient boundary layer, with ejections reaching streamwise lengths of 5 boundary layer thicknesses, the sweeps and ejections tend to be bigger in the adverse-pressure-gradient boundary layer. Moreover, small near-wall sweeps and ejections are much less numerous in the large-defect boundary layer. Large sweeps and ejections that reach the wall region (wall-attached) are also less numerous, less streamwise elongated and they occupy less space than in the zero-pressure-gradient boundary layer.},

Space and time are discrete, and the model is characterized by two parameters: one describes the probability to remain turbulent in the next step and the other characterizes the spreading of turbulence to the neighboring cells. The transition to a persistent turbulence is evident in mean field arguments, but the actual critical values and exponents are considerably renormalized by fluctuations. Extensive numerical tests show that the model falls into the universality class of one-dimensional (1D) directed percolation. We also discuss the spreading of localized perturbations and an extension to 2D systems.},

  abstract  = {This paper introduces two efficient algorithms that compute the Contour Tree of a three-dimensional scalar field F and its augmented version with the Betti numbers of each isosurface. The Contour Treeis a fundamental data structure in scientific visualization that isused to pre-process the domain mesh to allow optimal computation ofisosurfaces with minimal overhead storage. The Contour Tree can alsobe used to build user interfaces reporting the complete topologicalcharacterization of a scalar field, as shown inFigure{\textasciitilde}{\backslash}ref{\{}fig:top{\}}. Data exploration time is reduced since theuser understands the evolution of level set components with changingisovalue. The Augmented Contour Tree provides even more accurateinformation segmenting the range space of the scalar field into regions of invariant topology. The exploration time for a singleisosurface is also improved since its genus is known in advance.Our first new algorithm augments any given Contour Tree with theBetti numbers of all possible corresponding isocontours in lineartime with the size of the tree.  Moreover, we show how to extend thescheme introduced in [3] with the Betti numbercomputation without increasing its complexity.  Thus, we improve onthe time complexity in our previous approach fromO(m log m) to O(n log n + m), where m is the number of cellsand n is the number of vertices in the domain of F.Our second contribution is a new divide-and-conquer algorithm thatcomputes the Augmented Contour Tree with improved efficiency. Theapproach computes the output Contour Tree by merging twointermediate Contour Trees and is independent of the interpolant. Inthis way we confine any knowledge regarding a specific interpolantto an independent function that computes the tree for a singlecell. We have implemented this function for the trilinearinterpolant and plan to replace it with higher-order interpolantswhen needed. The time complexity is O(n + t log n), where t is thenumber of critical points of F. For the first time we cancompute the Contour Tree in linear time in many practical caseswhere t = O(n1--$\epsilon$). We report the running times for aparallel implementation, showing good scalability with the number ofprocessors. },

  abstract  = {This chapter describes a data-parallel, distributed-memory algorithm for identifying and labeling the connected sub-meshes within a three-dimensional mesh. The identification task is challenging in a distributed-memory setting because connectivity is transitive and the cells composing a sub-mesh may span many processors. The algorithm employs a multi-stage application of the Union-find algorithm and a spatial partitioning scheme to efficiently merge information across processors and to produce a global labeling of connected sub-meshes. Marking each vertex with its corresponding sub-mesh label allows mesh features to be isolated based on topology, enabling important analysis capabilities. The algorithm performs well in parallel; results are presented from a weak scaling study with concurrency levels up to 2,197 cores and meshes containing over two billion cells. This chapter is an extension of previous work by Harrison et. al. (Data-parallel mesh connected components labeling and analysis. In: EuroGraphics Symposium on Parallel Graphics and Visualization (EGPGV), pp. 131--140, April 2011). It contains significant algorithmic improvements over the previous version, improved exploration of key bottlenecks in the algorithm, and improved clarity of presentation.},

We prove here that h*(d) is finite for all d ≥ 3. In fact, we introduce a second critical parameter h** ≥ h*, show that h**(d) is finite for all d ≥ 3, and that the connectivity function of the excursion set above level h has stretched exponential decay for all h > h**. Finally, we prove that h* is strictly positive in high dimension. It remains open whether h* and h** actually coincide and whether h* > 0 for all d ≥ 3.},

Here we show how these results can be extended to other classes of graphs, significantly increasing the number and variety of solved problems. Any graph that can be decomposed into a certain arrangement of triangles, which we call self-dual, gives a class of lattices whose percolation thresholds can be found exactly by a recently introduced triangle–triangle transformation. We use this method to generalize Wierman's solution of the bow-tie lattice to yield several new solutions. We also give another example of a self-dual arrangement of triangles that leads to a further class of solvable problems. There are certainly many more such classes.},

However, this has two defects: not all of the properties described converge to the same solution, and the statistics computed are not always invariant under isosurface-preservlng transformations. We apply Federer's Coarea Formula from geometric measure theory to explain these discrepancies. We describe an improved substitute for histograms based on weighting with the inverse gradient magnitude, develop a statistical model that is invariant under isosurface-preserving transformations, and argue that this provides a consistent method for algorithm evaluation across multiple datasets based on histogram equalization. We use our corrected formulation to reevaluate recent results on average isosurface complexity, and show evidence that noise is one cause of the discrepancy between the expected figure and the observed one.},

The lattices include the square, triangular, honeycomb kagome, and diced lattices with nearest-neighbor bonds, and the square lattice with nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor bonds. Results are presented for the bond-percolation thresholds of the kagome and diced lattices, and the site-percolation thresholds of the square, honeycomb, and diced lattices. We also include the bond- and site-percolation thresholds for the square lattice with nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor bonds. We find that corrections to scaling behave according to the second temperature dimension Xt2=4 predicted by the Coulomb gas theory and the theory of conformal invariance. In several cases there is evidence for an additional term with the same exponent, but modified by a logarithmic factor. Only for the site-percolation problem on the triangular lattice does such a logarithmic term appear to be small or absent. The amplitude of the power-law correction associated with Xt2=4 is found to be dependent on the orientation of the lattice with respect to the cylindrical geometry of the finite systems.},

Under consideration is the modern fast progressing method of the turbulent flow control by air- and other gases (micro)blowing through a permeable surface, which is utilized in incompressible and compressible turbulent boundary layers. Several computational results to understand the essential flow physics are also included. The problem of simulation of the flow over a perforated wall where some ambiguities, in particular, at the permeable/impermeable boundary being still remained is discussed. Special attention is paid to the analysis of most important experimental and numerical results obtained with the air blowing through a finely-perforated surface, analysis of the physical peculiarities and regularities of the flow with the blowing, probability to describe the properties of such a flow within simple approach frameworks, evaluation of the efficiency of this control method, as well as the trends and opportunities of this method progress in view of state-of-the-art achievements. Although this technology has a penalty for developing the effective turbulent-flow control method, some modifications of the air blowing are an attractive alternative for real applications.},

The amplitude of uniform blowing or suction is set to be 0.1% of the free-stream velocity with different streamwise ranges of the controlled region. The boundary layer is thickened by blowing and thinned by suction. The Reynolds shear and normal stresses are increased by blowing and decreased by suction, most prominently, in the outer region. Through spectral analysis of the streamwise velocity and cross-spectra of the Reynolds shear stress, the enhancement and reduction of the fluctuation energy in the outer region by blowing and suction are found, respectively. It is also found that the emergence of a second peak in the outer region is promoted by blowing, while it is inhibited in the case of suction. In spite of the weak amplitude of the control, more than 10% of drag reduction and enhancement are achieved by means of blowing and suction, respectively. In the case of blowing, where drag reduction is achieved, the mean drag reduction rate increases as the blowing region extends because the local reduction rate, i.e.the streamwise gradient of the mean drag reduction rate, grows in the streamwise direction. The net-energy saving rate and the control gain have the same trends. It is found that a more effective skin friction drag reduction and control efficiency can be achieved with a wider control region that starts at a more upstream location.},

The discussion is confined to active open-loop control strategies, although feedback control is briefly mentioned with regard to peculiarities of spanwise sensing and/or actuation. Theoretical considerations are first given to explain why spanwise motion is expected to be particularly effective in skin-friction drag reduction. A review of the spanwise oscillating-wall technique is given next, with discussion of recent results and prospects. Last, waves of spanwise velocity are addressed, either spanwise- or streamwise-travelling. The latter include the oscillating wall as a special case. The generalized Stokes layer—i.e. the laminar, transverse oscillating boundary layer that develops under the action of the streamwise-travelling waves—is described, and its importance in determining turbulent drag reduction discussed. Finally, open issues like energetic efficiency and its dependence on Reynolds number are addressed. },

A special focus is laid upon a scheme in which the control input is applied only partially over a limited length in the streamwise direction, but not on the entire wall surface. The upstream control effect remains over a distance of about 11–14 times the pipe radius downstream of the point where the control is terminated. This results, however, in a simple relationship that the average drag reduction rate is nearly proportional to the control length. The recovery process after the control termination is quantitatively investigated by applying a recently proposed exact relation between the skin friction and the Reynolds stress distribution [Phys. Fluids 14 (11) (2002) L73–L76] and also by performing a budget analysis specially designed for that purpose.},

Direct numerical simulation of turbulent pipe flow shows that the friction drag can be successfully reduced by the derived control law. Moreover, the sign of Reynolds shear stress in the near-wall layer is found to be reversed with the present control.},

  abstract = {A new method for analysing nonlinear and non-stationary data has been developed. The key part of the method is the ‘empirical mode decomposition’ method with which any complicated data set can be decomposed into a finite and often small number of ‘intrinsic mode functions’ that admit well-behaved Hilbert transforms. This decomposition method is adaptive, and, therefore, highly efficient. Since the decomposition is based on the local characteristic time scale of the data, it is applicable to nonlinear and non-stationary processes. With the Hilbert transform, the ‘instrinic mode functions’ yield instantaneous frequencies as functions of time that give sharp identifications of imbedded structures. The final presentation of the results is an energy-frequency-time distribution, designated as the Hilbert spectrum. In this method, the main conceptual innovations are the introduction of ‘intrinsic mode functions’ based on local properties of the signal, which make the instantaneous frequency meaningful; and the introduction of the instantaneous frequencies for complicated data sets, which eliminate the need for spurious harmonics to represent nonlinear and non-stationary signals. Examples from the numerical results of the classical nonlinear equation systems and data representing natural phenomena are given to demonstrate the power of this new method. Classical nonlinear system data are especially interesting, for they serve to illustrate the roles played by the nonlinear and non-stationary effects in the energy-frequency-time distribution.},

(2002) [42]), we find that the suppression of the weighted Reynolds shear stress and spatial heterogeneity are both responsible for the drag reduction with riblets; while the drag increase in the other case is mostly related to the increasing contribution of spatial heterogeneity. From the analysis of anisotropy-invariant mapping, we observed that the local drag reductions near the riblet valley are accompanied by increasing turbulent anisotropy and forcing the near-wall turbulent structures at small scales to restructure and satisfy constraint of local one- or two-dimensionality, and the local drag increases near the riblet tip are accompanied by enhancing the turbulent anisotropy.},

The reduction in turbulent friction losses by the dilute addition of high–molecular weight polymers to flowing liquids has been extensively studied since the phenomenon was first observed over 60 years ago. Although it has long been reasoned that the dynamical interactions between polymers and turbulence are responsible for DR, it was not until recently that progress had been made to begin to elucidate these interactions in detail. These advancements come largely from numerical simulations of viscoelastic turbulent flows and detailed turbulence measurements in flows of dilute polymer solutions using laser-based optical techniques. This review presents a selective overview of the current state of the numerics and experimental techniques and their impact on understanding the mechanics and prediction of polymer DR. It includes a discussion of areas in which our understanding is incomplete, warranting further study. },

Here we show the first successful application of this approach to homogeneous turbulence time series. We associate each mode to dissipation, inertial range and integral scales. We then generalize this approach in order to characterize the scaling intermittency of turbulence in the inertial range, in an amplitude-frequency space. The new method is first validated using fractional Brownian motion simulations. We then obtain a 2D amplitude-frequency representation of the pdf of turbulent fluctuations with a scaling trend, and we show how multifractal exponents can be retrieved using this approach. We also find that the log-Poisson distribution fits the velocity amplitude pdf better than the lognormal distribution.},

  abstract = { Empirical mode decomposition has been shown to be a valuable data analysis tool in a wide array of technical fields, and it has recently emerged as a useful technique for studying complex fluid flows. This technique is useful for separating relevant unsteady spatiotemporal scales from a signal through an adaptive, iterative data-processing algorithm. Traditionally, empirical mode decomposition has been used to study time-dependent single-dimensional signals, though it can also be useful for studying multidimensional flowfield data. For the current study, unsteady velocity measurements were acquired across the initial development region of a turbulent-plane mixing layer using time-resolved particle image velocimetry. Empirical mode decomposition was applied to the resulting velocity field measurements to decompose the flowfield into several unsteady modes. Single-dimensional empirical mode decomposition was used to understand the time-frequency behavior of the flow associated with the formation and pairing process of large-scale vortical structures. The resulting spectrogram clearly displayed a periodic influence of large-scale vortex structures produced by the Kelvin–Helmholtz instability, which also exhibited a phase relationship with the vortex pairing mechanism. A multidimensional empirical mode decomposition analysis was also conducted, which allowed the unsteady velocity field to be decomposed into scale-based modes with dependence on x, y, and t dimensions. This analysis allowed the influence of small-scale turbulent structures within the flowfield to be separated from those associated with large-scale vortical structures produced by the Kelvin–Helmholtz instability. },

Chord-wise pressure distributions and highly-resolved force data of the wind turbine dedicated DU 00-W-212 profile were measured in the wind tunnel in two tailored turbulent inflow conditions generated with an active grid. A sinusoidal and an intermittent pattern with customized inflow angle fluctuations were generated providing two significantly different distributions of reduced frequencies.
